  "body": "# Survey for UP Diliman Students\r\n\r\nWe've been assigned to do a survey about the opinions of UP Diliman Students, particularly those pursuing Engineering and Science degrees, regarding software copyrights and patents and the extent of influence a particular piece of design, code or technology has on a whole product.\r\n\r\nThis survey is undertaken as part of CS 196, a course on ethical and professional issues in computing at the Department of Computer Science, during the first semester of Academic Year 2016-2017 in UP Diliman.\r\n\r\n## Team Members\r\n\r\n- Abby Ca√±edo\r\n- Carisse Dacuba\r\n- Vincent Fiestada\r\n- Arel Latoga\r\n- Troi Lobaton\r\n\r\n## Topic Description\r\n\r\n**Copyrights and Patents**. We examine two cases, Apple vs Samsung and Google vs Oracle. In the Apple vs Samsung case, should one design infringement be equivalent to the the worth of the entire product? In Google vs Oracle, are source codes unique?\r\n\r\n## Files in the Repository\r\n\r\nThe repository contains a Word XML file, which is a print-friendly version of the survey. Survey results, analyses and presentations (in TeX format) will be uploaded when available.",
