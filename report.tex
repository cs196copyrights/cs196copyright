\begin{abstract}
	In this paper, the authors take a look at the opinions of University of the Philippines Diliman Students, particularly those pursuing Engineering and Science degrees, regarding software copyrights and patents. In particular, we examine their opinions on the extent of influence that a particular piece of design or feature has on a whole product. This is done in the context of the Samsung vs. Apple and Oracle vs. Google trials about their similar products.
