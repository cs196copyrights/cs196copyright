<p>We've been assigned to do a survey about the opinions of UP Diliman Students, particularly those pursuing Engineering and Science degrees, regarding software copyrights and patents and the extent of influence a particular piece of design, code or technology has on a whole product.</p>

<p>This survey is undertaken as part of CS 196, a course on ethical and professional issues in computing at the Department of Computer Science, during the first semester of Academic Year 2016-2017 in UP Diliman.</p>

<a id="topic-description" class="anchor" href="#topic-description" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Topic Description</h2>

<p><strong>Copyrights and Patents</strong>. We examine two cases, Apple vs Samsung and Google vs Oracle. In the Apple vs Samsung case, should one design infringement be equivalent to the the worth of the entire product? In Google vs Oracle, are source codes unique?</p>

<h2>
<a id="files-in-the-repository" class="anchor" href="#files-in-the-repository" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Files in the Repository</h2>

<p>The repository contains a Word XML file, which is a print-friendly version of the survey form. Survey results, analyses and presentations (in TeX format) are also available in the repository. There is also a (now closed) online version of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf70UWimpysAH_UqTuL_-qszuZ_v--N4YSDjS-5yxGtWk8Aaw/viewform">form</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="tex-files" class="anchor" href="#tex-files" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TeX files</h2>

<p>The report is written in LaTeX and compiled using pdflatex from the MikTeX Windows implementation. It also uses a modified class file and some style files from the Association for Computing Machinery. The changes are only minor and are documented in the class file.</p>

<h2>
<a id="survey-responses" class="anchor" href="#survey-responses" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Survey Responses</h2>

<p>The raw survey results are available in the Excel file <code>results_charted.xlsx</code>. This workbook contains several worksheets, mostly containing Pivot Tables used for data analysis. The raw data is found in the worksheet labeled "Raw Data". The number of male and female respondents are equal. Note that to achieve this, some respondents were arbitrarily dropped in order to equalize the numbers. The worksheet contains all responses (from both online and print forms).</p>
